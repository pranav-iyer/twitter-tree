# Twitter Tree

A basic app that lets you visualize trees of replies to tweets. Written in Django and React.js.

It traverses through all the replies to a tweet, and the replies to those replies, and so on ... until you get something that looks like this:

## Usage (right now)

Right now I got it working in Ubuntu and on Mac OS 10.15.4â€”no idea what will happen if you try it on windows (it probably won't work for some reason or the other).

Dependencies:
- conda
- npm
- (I think that is it)

In order to run right now, here is what you have to do:

1. create conda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
2. start django server:
```
conda activate ttree
cd tt_backend
python manage.py runserver
```
3. (In a separate terminal window) start react server
```
cd tt_frontend
npm install
npm start
```
4. Open up in your web browser http://localhost:3000 and check it out!
